          <strong>Greek yogurt</strong> is a yogurt that has been strained to
          remove most of its whey, resulting in a thicker consistency than
          unstrained yogurt, while preserving yogurt's distinctive sour taste.
          Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk
          that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by
          adding extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe and North America,
          it is often made with low-fat or fat-free yogurt. In Iceland a similar
          product named skyr is produced.
